### Flattening, the Fully-connected Layer and the Single Neuron

As mentioned in section 4.1, there are multiple subtypes of neural networks besides CNN. As one of those subtypes, artificial neural networks (ANN) find widespread application in prediction based on tabular data. Their architecture is also harnessed in the fully-connected (FC) layers of CNN, which forms the final section of the forward pass and results in a prediction.
