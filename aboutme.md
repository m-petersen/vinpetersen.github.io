I'm a medical student studying at the [UKE Hamburg](https://www.uke.de/english/index.html) with a special interest in neurology, neuroimaging and deep learning.

Besides studying, I'm currently working on my doctoral thesis in clinical stroke imaging at the [SFB936](https://twitter.com/SFB_936). My focus there lies on brain image processing and connectomics and thus my thesis is embedded in a neuro- and computer-scientific environment.

I would describe myself as sincerely passionate about learning as well as teaching. Therefore, I want to use this blog to capture and share my knowledge about the things I have learned. In addition, I would like to convey the results of my research here in a more considerate and illustrative way than scientific papers allow.
